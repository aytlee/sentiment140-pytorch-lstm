# sentiment140-pytorch-lstm
Application of a bidrectional LSTM on the Sentiment 140 Twitter dataset using Pytorch. 

This notebook is an exercise in how to apply PyTorch's bidirectional LSTM on text data. It follows two tutorials (links can be found in the notebook):
1. LSTM Text Classification Using PyTorch by Raymond Chang
2. Upgraded Sentiment Analysis by Ben Trevett

The dataset used is the Sentiment140 Twitter dataset created by Alec Go, Richa Bhayani, and Lei Huang, who were Computer Science graduate students at Stanford University. The dataset can be found here, http://help.sentiment140.com/home with additional information on how the data was collected and analysed.
